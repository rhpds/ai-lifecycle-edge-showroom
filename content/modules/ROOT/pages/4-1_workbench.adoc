= Create a workbench

Inside the new project, we can create different components. One of them, and probably the most important one when it comes to model training, will be the Workbench. A workbench is a containerized workspace that operates within a pod and contains a collection of different AI/ML libraries and a JupyterLab server.

. There are different tabs inside our project page. Click on *Workbenches*.
. On there, select the *Create workbench* button to open the configuration window.

. Complete the fields as follows. You will see that there are plenty of different configurations depending on your model and environment specifications:
 ** *Name*: Type your preferred name. I will use `model-training`.
 ** *Image selection*: the election will depend on the model requirements. Click on View package information to see the packages included. Our model will use `Jupyter | TensorFlow | CUDA | Python 3.12`.
 ** *Version selection*: The recommendation is to use the latest package versions. That will be the `2025.2` version.
 ** *Container size*: we can select the resources assigned depending on our hardware: number of CPUs, memory, and request capacity of the container. In this case, the `Small` size is enough.
 ** Make sure a persisten volume called `model-training-storage` is going to be created with `20GB`.
 ** Under connections, select *Attach existing connections*. Verify that the `vehicle-models` connection is selected and click *Attach*.
. Review your configuration and press *Create workbench*. This last step will trigger the workbench creation.
. You will be automatically redirected to another page where you can track the workbench deployment process. Wait until the _Status_ shows *Running* and click *model-training*.

. A new tab will open. Enter again your OpenShift credentials to authenticate to the workbench's JupyterLab platform.

* *User*: {openshift_cluster_admin_username}
* *Password*: {openshift_cluster_admin_password}
