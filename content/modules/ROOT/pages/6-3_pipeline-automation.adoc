= Pipelines scheduled automation

Our machine learning models need to adapt to evolving data patterns to maintain their accuracy and relevance. By scheduling our pipeline to run automatically every 10 minutes, we ensure that both the Stress Detection and Time to Failure Prediction models are continuously retrained with the latest battery data collected from the BMS application. This automated approach eliminates manual intervention, reduces the risk of model drift, and guarantees that our predictive models always reflect the most current battery behavior patterns.

== Schedule recurring execution

Now let's configure the pipeline to execute automatically:

. Now, let's go back to the *Pipelines* view in the left-hand menu.
. Click again on the *Three dots* at the far right of our *Model Retraining* pipeline.

. Select *Create schedule* from the dropdown menu.
. Fill in the schedule configuration form:
 ** *Name*: `Scheduled run`
 ** *Trigger type*: Select *Periodic*
 ** *Run every*: `10` `minutes`
. Scroll down and verify that the *Model Retraining* pipeline has been automatically selected.
. Check that the *Parameters* match the following values:
