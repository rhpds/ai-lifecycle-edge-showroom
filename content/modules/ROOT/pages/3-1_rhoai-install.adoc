= Red Hat OpenShift AI installation

The fundamental piece and operational hub will be the Red Hat OpenShift AI platform, running in our Single Node OpenShift. The RHOAI operator provides data scientists and developers the possibility to work within a common platform where they can collaborate during the entire model lifecycle, making use of both containerization perks and several machine learning and data analytics capabilities.

. Open the *OpenShift Web Console* and log in using the credentials provided with in the lab instructions. The Console URL is:
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
{openshift_cluster_console_url}
----
+
* *User*: {openshift_cluster_admin_username}
* *Password*: {openshift_cluster_admin_password}

. Navigate to the *Operators* tab on the left panel. Then select *OperatorHub*.
. Type `OpenShift AI` to search the item in the operators' catalog.
. Select the *Red Hat OpenShift AI* operator and click on *Install*. The most recent version will be displayed by default.
. The operator will create the `redhat-ods-operator` project. Review the rest of the parameters and press *Install* to start the operator installation.
. When the installation finishes, we need to configure the DataScienceCluster custom resource. Select *Create DataScienceCluster*
. Once in the configuration page, scroll down and click *Components*. Here you can see a list of all the components that can be enabled/disabled from Red Hat OpenShift AI. It's on this step when we enable the different components. Reproduce the following setup:
 ** Locate and select the *kserve* component. Unless otherwise specified, the default deployment mode used by kserve will be Serverless. Change the *defaultDeploymentMode* to *RawDeployment* and verify that the *managementState* shows *Managed*.
 ** Also, under *serving*, we need to modify the KNative-Serving stack used for model serving. As mentioned before, the RawDeployment mode does not use KNative. Therefore, we need to switch the *managementState* to *Removed*.
 ** Finally, scroll down to the *trustyAI* configuration and enable the component by switching again the *managementState* field to *Managed*.
. The configuration should look like this:
+

+

. Keep the rest of the default values and press *Create*.
. Wait for the _Phase_ to become _Ready_. This will mean that the operator is successfully configured and can be used.

Now, we should be able to access the OpenShift AI Web Console. On the right side of the top navigation bar, you will find a square icon formed by 9 smaller squares. Click it and select *Red Hat OpenShift AI* from the dropdown menu:

A new tab will open. Log in using your OpenShift credentials:

* *User*: {openshift_cluster_admin_username}
* *Password*: {openshift_cluster_admin_password}

You may need to authorize access to our user. If so, click *Allow selected permissions* and you will be redirected to the Red Hat OpenShift AI landing page:
